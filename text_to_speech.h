 * allocate additional memory and adjusts the string in place.

 *
 * @note
 * - The input string `str` must be mutable and large enough to hold the modified string.
 * - If `str` is `NULL`, the function has no effect.
 * - If `remove_chars` is `NULL` or empty, `str` remains unchanged.
 * - The function compares characters based on their exact value and does not account for locale-specific variations.
